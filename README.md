# Real-Time-Pose-Estimation-Activity-Recognition
This project utilizes OpenCV for real-time pose detection and activity classification. The model detects body poses and classifies them into activities like push-up and squat positions. It also counts the number of repetitions performed, providing a seamless solution for fitness tracking.
